This repository contains the R codes implemented for the master's degree thesis of Clara Tapia Pérez. The codes are contained in the following files:
- cvmcens_imhof.R: implementation of the Cramér-von Mises test adapted for right censored data using Imhof's method for the inversion of the characteristic function and approximation of p-value.
- cvmcens_pelaez.R: implementation of the Cramér-von Mises test adapted for right censored data using Gil-Pelaez's theorem for the inversion of the characteristic function and approximation of p-value.
- simulation.R: code implemented for the simulation study.
